# Oblivious Transfer Implementation

## Overview

This code implements oblivious transfer, a cryptographic protocol that plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and privacy of financial transactions. Oblivious transfer ensures that sensitive information is encrypted and stored in a way that allows access to specific details without compromising unnecessary data. This approach strikes a balance between data accessibility and the paramount need for privacy and security.

## Key Features

- **Privacy Preservation:** Oblivious transfer is instrumental in securing financial transactions by encrypting and storing them securely. This prevents the exposure of sensitive details and ensures that only authorized parties can access specific information.

- **Data Accessibility:** The implementation allows for authorized access to encrypted transaction details, ensuring that individuals can retrieve necessary information without revealing unnecessary specifics.

## Practical Applications

### Private Financial Transactions

In scenarios where individuals need to make financial transactions without divulging specific details to the other party, oblivious transfer can be applied. The payer engages in oblivious transfer with the payee, enabling the secure transmission of encrypted transaction details.

### MySQL Integration

In the context of an SQL database like MySQL, a schema is typically employed to structure tables for storing information related to financial transactions. Each transaction record within these tables may include fields such as amount, timestamp, sender_account, receiver_account, etc. The oblivious transfer implementation can be seamlessly integrated with MySQL databases to enhance the security and privacy of financial data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/oblivious-transfer.git
   cd oblivious-transfer
   ```

2. **Installation and Setup:**

   Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use the following command:

   ```bash
   need to have gcc install
   For linux and mac os enviorment its prebuilt.
   For windows u have to install gcc
   ```

3. **Usage:**

   C Code already created.
   Need to compile and run the output using following command : 
   For compilation: gcc -std=c99 -o OT ot.c 
   For Run: ./OT
   Refere to the sql file template for example in buisness purpose.
